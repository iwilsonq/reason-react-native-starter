# Reason React Native

This project is a starting point for setting up a React Native project that uses ReasonML.

It is essentially a from scratch `react-native init <projectName>` setup. It also depends on

- `bs-platform`
- `reason-react`
- `bs-react-native`

# Installation

You'll need xcode or the android simulator in order to run a React Native project. You will also need to install the React Native CLI if you haven't already.

```sh
  npm i -g react-native-cli

  git clone git@github.com:iwilsonq/reason-react-starter

  npm install

  react-native run-ios
  # OR
  react-native run-android

  # Wait for the simulator to get set up, then check it out!
```
